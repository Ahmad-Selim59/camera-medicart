This test application verifies that the CameraCtrl SDK can control your camera
via USB on a Windows computer.

FILES INCLUDED:
- main.cpp              : Source code for the test application
- CameraCtrl.h          : SDK header file
- CameraCtrl.dll        : SDK dynamic library (required at runtime)
- CameraCtrl.lib        : SDK import library (required for linking)
- CameraControlTest.sln : Visual Studio solution file
- CameraControlTest.vcxproj : Visual Studio project file
- build.bat             : Batch file for command-line building
- CMakeLists.txt        : CMake build configuration
- Makefile              : Makefile for MinGW

================================================================================
BUILDING THE APPLICATION
================================================================================

METHOD 1: Visual Studio (EASIEST)
----------------------------------
1. Double-click "CameraControlTest.sln" to open in Visual Studio
2. Select "Release" or "Debug" configuration (x64 platform)
3. Press F7 or go to Build > Build Solution
4. Executable will be in: x64\Release\CameraControlTest.exe
   (or x64\Debug\CameraControlTest.exe)

METHOD 2: Command Line (Visual Studio)
---------------------------------------
1. Open "Developer Command Prompt for VS" from Start menu
2. Navigate to this directory
3. Run: build.bat
4. Executable will be: CameraControlTest.exe

METHOD 3: CMake
---------------
1. Open CMake GUI
2. Set source directory to this folder
3. Set build directory (e.g., build/)
4. Configure and Generate
5. Open generated solution and build

================================================================================
RUNNING THE APPLICATION
================================================================================

1. Ensure CameraCtrl.dll is in the same directory as CameraControlTest.exe
   (Visual Studio automatically copies it to the output folder)

2. Connect your camera via USB to the Windows computer

3. Run CameraControlTest.exe

4. Follow the menu:
   a) Select option 1 to list available cameras
   b) Select option 2 to connect to a camera (enter the index number)
   c) Test various controls (options 3-10)

TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

Problem: "No cameras found"
Solution: 
- Check USB connection
- Verify camera appears in Windows Device Manager
- Camera must support UVC extension units
- Check if camera PID matches: 8888, 7588, 9999, or 00f9

Problem: "Failed to connect"
Solution:
- Try different USB port
- Close other applications using the camera
- Restart the application
- Check camera driver installation

Problem: "DLL not found" or similar runtime error
Solution:
- Ensure CameraCtrl.dll is in the same folder as the executable
- Copy DLL manually if needed
- Check Windows PATH environment variable

Problem: Build errors
Solution:
- Use Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt
- Verify all SDK files are present
- Check Windows SDK is installed
- Try cleaning and rebuilding

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

Once you've verified the camera controls work:
1. Document which features work and which don't
2. Note any limitations or issues
3. Proceed to set up server/client architecture for remote control
4. The SDK can be used on the server side to control the camera
5. Create a network interface layer on top of the SDK
